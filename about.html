    <p>Introduction: We are probably living in the worst time our modern society has ever seen in terms of women security. We aim to make women feel as strong as ever and strong enough to fight the parasites of our society, strong enough to fight the
      odds, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assaults. We aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist. Our idea is to design a system which shall make every place and every hour safer for women again. A system
      which shall re-establish how very gregarious mankind is. This system shall geotag and send SOS alert to the nearest police station, close contacts and also alert people in and around the venue of the crime, everything just at a click of a
      button. The idea is to make up for the time it takes police to arrive at the location.</p>
    <p>Problems:Among the worst countries in crime, India has an abhorrent track record in all forms of sexual exploitation. In homes, on streets, in public transports and even offices. Indian women are in a constant state of vigilance, like a
      country on terrorist alert. There have been grotesque cases of rapes of toddlers, gang rape of eight years old and women trafficking. We have created a nation where women are learning to cope with existential anxiety and we should be ashamed.
      A lot of NGOs, rehabilitation centres and helpline numbers have been made operational in the past years but they are all cures to the harassment that has already happened and not the ‘preventions’ that we need. There are certain pre-existing
      apps that do send a message to the saved contacts but none of them is effective and quick enough and according to a survey, the existing technology doesn’t make most women feel safe. A major change in the basic structure and a few add-ons to
      these is a necessity. In a lot of cases, it is observed that women do not file a complaint against the accused because of various reasons like not knowing the correct authority to report it to or feeling ashamed/guilty about the incident.</p>
    <p>Objective: We are focusing on building an effective, fast and reliant system to make the women of India feel safe and empowered.
      Our platform will act as a 24/7 active help and companion for women so that they don’t ever feel that they are alone in the middle of a crisis situation.
      It will unite and enable the citizens of India and the police to work towards a common problem. This tool will act as eyes and ears for the police and help them in preventing crimes against women. This tool has been designed in a manner that it
      covers the various situations a woman can be stuck in like when she is alone or when she is in a crowded place or when she is in a public transport etc.</p>
    <p>Implementation: The users need to register themselves on the web application by creating their own account. This web application service shall be a one-time registration, the users are required to fill in their basic details at the time of
      registration. After making an account user would be qualified to use all the services intended to protect and empower them. Services include an automated distress SOS to the nearest police station and to her emergency contacts, not only this
      the app will also automatically send in distress signals to the nearby people within a specified radius with a live location. The user can also lodge an FIR against the alleged person which shall be geotagged on the digital map and timestamped.
      We also look forward to ensure women safety in public transport, we propose that every public transport is it a bus, cab or an autorickshaw shall be fitted with a GPS device which will be monitored by the police at all times.</p>
