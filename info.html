    <div class="col">
      <p class="fs-4"> According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and their family is to be penalized. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often asked
        of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic independence of women and the taboo
        towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even after marriage are not met by the girl’s families many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt.
        It is one of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand.
